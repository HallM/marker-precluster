# marker-precluster

The library can compute clusters of markers external of a map for later rendering.

This is a port of the [MarkerClustererPlus](https://github.com/googlemaps/v3-utility-library/blob/master/markerclustererplus) v2.1.2 to run in NodeJS.

MarkerClustererPlus is an enhanced V3 implementation of the [V2 MarkerClusterer](http://gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/) by Xiaoxi Wu.
It is based on the [V3 MarkerClusterer](http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/tags/markerclusterer/) port by Luke Mahe.
MarkerClustererPlus was created by Gary Little.
